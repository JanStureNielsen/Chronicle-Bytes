= Chronicle Bytes Microbenchmarks
:lang: en-GB

This module contains JMH benchmarks that measure the throughput of common
operations such as primitive writes, string parsing and CAS updates.

== Purpose
The benchmarks help detect performance regressions and guide optimisation work.

== How to Run
From this directory execute:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -q clean verify
----

Results are printed on the console after the JMH harness completes.

== Adding Benchmarks
Create a new class under `src/main/java` and follow the existing patterns.
Each benchmark should document what it measures and keep setup code minimal.
